# physics_spectroscopy

In 2009 I finished a Masters Degree in Chemistry, emphasizing Chemical Physics.

My research consisted of developing theory, starting from first principles of quantum mechanics, towards modeling experimental spectroscopy results.

I wrote a lot of Matlab code and am going to try and reconstruct it here.
