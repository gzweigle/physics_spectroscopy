# physics_spectroscopy

In 2009 I finished a Masters Degree in Chemistry, emphasizing Chemical Physics.

My research was in the area of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC). The work (fun!) consisted of developing theory, starting from first principles of quantum mechanics, to model experimental spectroscopy results.

I implemented my models in Matlab and reconstructed them in 2017 to post here.
