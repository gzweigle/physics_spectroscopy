# physics_spectroscopy

In 2009 I finished a Masters Degree in Chemistry, emphasizing Chemical Physics.

My research consisted of developing theory, starting from first principles of quantum mechanics, towards modeling experimental spectroscopy results.

I implemented my models in Matlab and reconstructed them in 2017 to post here.

The work was published here:
G.C. Zweigle, J.L. McHale, "Theory of Transition-Dipole Coupling in Dye-Sensitized Semiconductor Nanoparticles", J. Phys. Chem. C, 2011, 115 (28), pp 13693-13703.
